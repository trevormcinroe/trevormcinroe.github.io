I am a 2nd year PhD student at The University of Edinburgh in the 
<a href='https://www.bayeswatch.com/'>Bayesian and Neural Systems</a> group advised by 
<a href='https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/'>Amos Storkey</a> and the
<a href="https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Autonomous Agents Research Group</a> advised by
<a href="https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/">Stefano Albrecht</a>.

My goal is to bring reinforcement learning agents to the real world. 

Prior to my PhD, I worked for five years in industry on problems like vision for autonomous vehicles at Toyota Connected and completed my master's at Northwestern University.
