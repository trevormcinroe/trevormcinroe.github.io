I am a 3rd year PhD student at The University of Edinburgh, advised by [Amos Storkey](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/) as a member of the [Bayesian and Neural Systems Group](https://www.bayeswatch.com/) in the [Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/anc).

I am interested in getting reinforcement learning into the real world by focusing on:

- Offline settings (and variations therein)
- Representation learning for high-dimensional observation spaces
- Model-based methods
- Off-policy methods
